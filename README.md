# CV and Resume Templates

Templates used and modified for my CV and resume. 

```
├── Industry_resume
```
This repo contains TeX files for my custom resume. Please feel free to use.

Originally, this resume was a simple `.tex` based file, but I've since converted it to `.Rnw` format to allow compilation of R graphics using ggplot. I use RStudio to compile (instead of my preferred TeXShop), but you might find you prefer different typesetting application.

I encountered some font incompatibilities switching from TeXShop to RStudio, so please be cautious and compile piecewise as necessary.

├── Academic_CV
```
This repo contains TeX files for my CV, based off of the Deedy CV/Resume. Take note of which compiler to use within TeX (XeLaTex). Many thanks to existing developers and resources for giving me a jumping off point!
