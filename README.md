# CV and Resume Templates

Templates used and modified for my CV and resume. 

```
├── Industry_resume
```
This repo contains TeX files for my custom resume. Please feel free to use.

Originally, this resume was a simple `.tex` based file, but I've since converted it to `.Rnw` format to allow compilation of R graphics using ggplot. I use RStudio to compile (instead of my preferred TeXShop), but you might find you prefer different typesetting application.

I encountered some font incompatibilities switching from TeXShop to RStudio, so please be cautious and compile piecewise as necessary.

├── Academic_CV
```
This repo contains TeX files for my CV, based off the Johns Hopkins official CV template (MS Word). 

Peruse back to previous commits to see my rendition of the Deedy CV/Resume. If doing so, take note of which compiler to use within TeX (XeLaTex).
