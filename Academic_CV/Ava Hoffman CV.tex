\section*{ADDITIONAL INFORMATION}

\subsection*{Personal Statement}

My primary goal is to make data science and bioinformatic tools more accessible to diverse audiences by synthesizing across approaches, disciplines, and data sources. I aim to communicate across multiple domains, from academic publications to peer and community education and outreach, by developing reproducible and approachable educational resources and data science tools. I am particularly interested in empowering individuals to gain intuition for data that does not adhere to traditional norms or structure, especially in genetics research. I am also interested in integrating and developing the emerging field of environmental and ecological data science with public health initiatives. Overall, my broad, interdisciplinary background helps me approach problems holistically and serves to bring stakeholders and experts from multiple pathways together.
